      <h2>Site Intent</h2>
      <p> The goal for the resign of the Truffles and Trifles website is to try to get the content to be more focused by condensing it to fewer pages. A few of the links on the main page link to the same page as other links. The site design is hard to read at times, not to mention that the design itself has no consistency or harmony. By redesigning the website's layout and using a template and color scheme throughout, we can make the website more harmonious and attractive to look at as well as helping to increase the branding of the product/company. It is in need of a reworking of the CSS and HTML to meet W3C standards as well as mobile friendly site design..</p>

      <ul>
      <li><a href="http://www.dessertlady.com/">Dessert Lady</a> (Ranked #8,389,149 in the world) is also located in Orlando. The website while colorful with a consistent design and good branding throughout has a lot of information that is very condensed and could be considered 'busy'. </li>
      <li><a href="http://farrisandfosters.com/"/>Farris and Fosters</a> with a rank of 5,198,313 and has been online since 2001. Located in Orlando as well, the website is in desperate need of an update to meet W3C standards, much of the text is hard to read, a few of the links were broken as well, however the sidebar was interesting with the concept of a rollover image making the little chocolates appear to be eaten when selected.</li>
      <li><a href="http://www.ediblearrangements.com/"/>Edible Arrangements</a> is a well known chain that arranges gift baskets, while it's not a cooking school or does it offer classes, it would be a competitor when it comes to gifts. It has a global rank of #34,424. The website is clean, has excellent branding, easy to navigate, and easy on the eye. And it has a mobile friendly website.</li>
